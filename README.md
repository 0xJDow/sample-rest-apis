# sample-rest-apis

A collection of the same, simple, REST API using various languages and frameworks.

# Why?

As a penetration tester and web application security researcher, being able to parse through source code and find high-impact bugs is important. I'm of the mindset that one of the best ways to improve white box code review skills is to write a little code in the given language and framework in order to establish some familiarty.

In this repo I will be writing the same, simple, web API in all of the modern web application frameworks that I come up against during my engagements and research with the intent of sharpening my own skills and improving my knowledge of these languages and frameworks.

# Languagues & Frameworks

This repo is organized hierarchically by language and framework in order to make navigation straightforward. Each framework's folder will contain source code for the sample REST API along with a `README.md` file that explains how to build it.

```
├── Java
│   ├── java-ee
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── spring-boot
│       └── README.md
└── Python
    ├── django
    │   └── README.md
    └── flask
        └── README.md
```

Links to the various `README.md` files are below, for convenience.
